Packages to read, write and convert audio tags. It's cross-platform with great performance thanks to the Rust Flutter Bridge.
I used <a href="https://github.com/invertase/melos" target="_blank">melos</a> to manage both a speared Dart and Flutter packages in the same repo and GitHub Actions for CI\CD.
